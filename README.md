My name is Roxanna Munoz. I am a third year industrial design student. I was
interested in computing because I really want to get my portfolio out there,
and I have found it difficult to start.  Most blogs and website creaters offer
templates, but I really want to have control over the aesthetics of my own
website.  Also I have been told that web development is on demand, I would
really enjoy having extra money.
